A classical Tic-Tac-Toe game application using C++

üí´ About this project:

‚≠ê This project is created using the C++ programming language.

‚≠ê INTRODUCTION: <br>
    ‚û°Ô∏è In this game, two players alternately place X's and 0's into a 3x3 playing field. <br>
    ‚û°Ô∏è Before starting the game, both the players have to agree as to who will make the first move and with which symbol. <br>
    ‚û°Ô∏è After the first move, the players alternately place their marks in any empty cell. <br>
    ‚û°Ô∏è The goal of the game is to be the first player with same three marks in a horizontal, diagonal or  vertical line. <br>
    ‚û°Ô∏è If there are no empty cells and neither player has a winning combination, the game is a draw. <br>
    ‚û°Ô∏è The program creates a simple and user-friendly interface first for the user. <br> 
    ‚û°Ô∏è Then it asks the user to enter their choices and verifies whether the choices exercised by the user has been opted before or not. <br> 
    ‚û°Ô∏è If not,it allocates the user the opted place and shows the necessary change on the tic-tac-toe table. <br>
    ‚û°Ô∏è After each move, the program checks whether that move results in the win of the player. <br>
    ‚û°Ô∏è If yes, it displays the message and the game is over, else, the other player gets the chance. <br>
    ‚û°Ô∏è If all places fill out without anyone winning the game, the game ends in a draw.
